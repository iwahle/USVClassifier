train_main: main script for training new model
predict_main: main script for predicting annotations for spectrograms
helper functions:
	- syl_filter
		- consecutive_ones
	- fill_gaps
	- pca_red
	- process_labels
	- single_chunk
	- disp_syls (displays all positive syllables side by side)
other functions that aren't being used right now but that might be useful
	- kmeansclustering: preliminary clustering method for a spectrogram
	- kmeansfolder: same as kmeansclustering but on a folder of spectrograms
	- prec_rec: calculates precision, recall, and f1 score
	- single_chunk2: instead of giving training examples as vectorized chunks,
			 gives them as a vector with the current frame, the mean over
			 the chunk, and the standard deviation over the chunk

mdl1_net.m is a trained model with 3x as many negatives as there are positive examples.
It adds noise scaled by 0, 0.75, and -0.75 and normalizes before and after. 
It reduces down to 60 features with PCA.
In-sample performance is: prec = 93.7605, rec = 76.1433, f1s = 84.0385.
Still has trouble picking up all of the syllables out-of-sample.
